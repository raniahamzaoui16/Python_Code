Le ciel, d’un bleu profond, se fondait lentement dans les teintes orangées du coucher du soleil. Au loin, des oiseaux en migration traçaient des arcs élégants dans l’air, tandis que l’odeur salée de l’océan emplissait l’atmosphère. Les gens sur la plage semblaient tous absorbés par cette scène tranquille, chacun perdu dans ses pensées, mais unis par la beauté de l’instant.\n",
