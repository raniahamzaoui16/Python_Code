For example:\\n    > \\\"You are a band of three adventurers who have stumbled upon the entrance to a goblin lair. The villagers of Oakhaven have offered a small reward for any adventurer who can retrieve their stolen family heirloom, a magical music box. Do you dare enter?\\\"\\n\\n2.  **Player Turns:** On each turn, one of you will be prompted to make a choice for the group. I'll rotate turns to keep it fair. The choices are multiple-choice or sometimes yes/no.\\n3.  **Choice Consequences:** Each choice will have a potential outcome. Some will lead to success, others to challenges or even failure. Some might involve a virtual dice roll (I will handle that).\\n4.  **Cooperation:** Since it's cooperative, players should try to agree (or at least discuss) what they want to do.\\n5.  **Winning/Losing:** If the group makes the right choices, they reach the goal and win! If they make too many bad choices (or get eliminated), they lose.\\n\\n**Ready to begin?**\\n\\nHere's our starting scenario:\\n\\n> The air is damp and smells of mildew as you stand before the dark maw of the goblin's lair. Three of you, a courageous warrior named [Player 1 Name Here], a nimble rogue named [Player 2 Name Here], and a wise mage named [Player 3 Name Here] stand ready. The path in splits into three directions, each barely big enough to squeeze through. Which path will you choose?\\n\\n**Before we start, can you each tell me the names you want for your characters?** (e.g., \\\"My warrior's name is Borin\\\", etc.)\\n\\nOnce I have those, we can get the adventure started!\\n\",\n",

The remaining goblins flee in terror.\\n\\n>With the goblins scattered, you have a chance to catch your breath and examine the magical music box. You realize that it's the exact item the villagers described.\\n\\n**Congratulations! You have successfully retrieved the magical music box from the Goblin's Lair!**\\n\\n**You won the game!**\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Game Summary:**\\n\\n*   You explored the Goblin's Lair.\\n*   You had some close calls with giant rats and goblins!\\n*   You used teamwork to overcome challenges.\\n*   You successfully retrieved the magical music box!\\n\\n---\\n\\nI hope you enjoyed the game!
